# Gambetta Local (Hotseat) Demo
Unity Demo - "Fast-Paced Multiplayer (Part I): Client-Server Game Architecture"

# Description
This is a minimal demo project made in Unity 2017.2.0f3 (but it should work in older versions as well). 
The demo project is a very close implementation of the ["Gambetta Demo" on Network Architecture](http://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-server-game-architecture.html) - All credits to Gabriel Gambetta for that.
