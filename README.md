# Gambetta Local (Hotseat) Demo
Unity Demo - "Fast-Paced Multiplayer (Part I): Client-Server Game Architecture"

# Description
This is a minimal demo project made in Unity 2017.2.0f3 (but it should work in older versions as well). 
The demo project is a very close implementation of the ["Gambetta Demo" on Network Architecture](http://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-server-game-architecture.html) - All credits to Gabriel Gambetta for that.

The demo is basically a `C#` Unity implementation of [Gambetta's Live Demo](http://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-side-prediction-live-demo.html).

# Instructions
1. Open up the scene "GambettaLocalDemoScene"
2. Hit 'Play' in Unity
3. Play around with settings on the "World" game object in the scene

# Networked Demo
See [this repository](https://github.com/RamiAhmed/Gambetta_NetworkedDemo) for a networked (multiplayer) demo version of this project.
